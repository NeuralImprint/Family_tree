# Family_tree
This is a simple Python program that creates and visualizes a family tree using Hindi relationship names written in English (like papa, mummy, dadaji, etc.). The program welcomes the user with a friendly message in Hindi and allows them to input their family members one by one by specifying the relationship. It builds a directed graph where nodes represent family members and arrows represent relationships. Finally, it displays a neat, labeled family tree using networkx and matplotlib. The code is personalized with function names like ankit_family_tree() to add a custom touch. This project is beginner-friendly and blends simple machine learning ideas with fun family mapping.
